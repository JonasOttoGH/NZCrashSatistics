# NZCrashSatistics
A dashboard based on the New Zealand crash statistics from 2000-2023 using SQL and PowerBI. Data is recorded by the NZ Police Department and then handed to the Ministry of Transport. Public access to certain limited data collected can be found on the official Ministry of transport website for public viewing. 

Limitations of project: Although there was more than sufficient data, there was no crash data (except for year) and no data on civilians like other global public crash data. Therefore, I found data quick limited in creating a comprehensive dashboard.  


Prepare:

- Data used downloaded from https://www.transport.govt.nz/statistics-and-insights/safety-annual-statistics/
- Data was imported into Microsoft SQL Server

Process:

Data that was needed for visualisation was extracted and processed using Microsoft SQL Server (please refer to attached script for more details)

Analyse/Share:
- Synoptic panel by Okviz was used to create a regional map of New Zealand for visualization
- Finally, an interactive dashboard was made using Power BI.
